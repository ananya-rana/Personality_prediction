Myers–Briggs personality prediction


o	Predicting the personality of a person from their last 50 social media posts.
o	Used spacy library for text preprocessing, used various word embedding approaches such Tf-IDF, Bag of Words and n-grams. Realizing that the data was hugely imbalanced, I tried using SMOTE to address the issue as well. Then I used Word2Vec which generally works better with SMOTE, but in this case it didn’t. I have provided the possible reasons as to why it could have happened. Finally applied ensemble methods for prediction.
o	This project can have interesting applications, such as in the field of neuromarketing, to gain insight into customers’ motivation, preferences and decisions, which can help inform creative advertising, product development, pricing, and other marketing areas.
